# Lance Modpacks
A new repo for some utilities for my new project (Lance Modpacks) for installing custom modpacks with no problems.

## How does it work
The file [modpacks.json](https://github.com/redtyyt/lancemodpacks/blob/resources/modpacks.json) will be fetched by the app, then the list of modpacks will be displayed onto the application UI (in a scrollbox).

## Release date
**On 17/08/2025 this application will be released on this github pages, and even some modpacks will.**
